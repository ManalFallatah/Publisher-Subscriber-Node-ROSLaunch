# Publisher-Subscriber-Nodes-ROSLaunch
"Node" is the ROS term for an executable that is connected to the ROS network. 
Here we will create the publisher ("talker") node which will continually broadcast a message.
And connect it to a topic that the subscriber ("listener") will receive the publisher broadcast from.
